## Hashing and Linked lists efficiency
This application provides a way to compare these two data structures by using a wordlist, storing them on the data structures and then searching the user inputs on them.

Originally, this assignment required only the image to be submited, but I decided to add more information related to data structures as it is important to know the difference between them. Think of this repository as a small report.

The following image shows the difference in the numbers.

## The Conclusion
The main difference between the times is due to the way that data is handled.
* Hash Tables
  * Stores the data in no particular order
  * Quick access times

* Linked Lists
    * Items stored in order they are added
    * Possibly longer search times due the search having to go through the whole list
